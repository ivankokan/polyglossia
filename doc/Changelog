1.47 (???)

New features:
  * IETF BCP-47 compliant language tags can now be used for loading and switching
    languages alternatively to language names (#226).
  * New commands \languageid{<type>} and \mainlanguageid{<type>}.
  * New test \iflanguageidloaded.
  * New list \xpg@bcp@loaded.
  * New environment {lang}{<lang>} (equivalent to {<lang>},  but also available with
    \setlanguagealias* which does not define dedicated alias environments).
  * New gloss option totalhyphenmin (corresponds to LuaTeX's \hyphenationmin) (#111).
  * New test \iflanguageoption{<lang>}{<key>}{<val>} (#364).
  * Restore simple alphabetic numbering for \asbuk and \Asbuk in Belarusian, Mongolian,
    Russian, Serbian, and Ukrainian (#377).
  * New command \AsbukTrad and \asbukTrad for Belarusian, Mongolian, Russian, Serbian,
    and Ukrainian which uses traditional alphanumerical numbering.
  * New numerals option "cyrillic-trad" and "cyrillic-alph" to differentiate simple
    alphabetic and traditional alpnanumerical Cyrillic numbering.
  * \selectbackgroundlanguage and \resetdefaultlanguage now also support language
    aliases.
  * New macro \charifavailable{<char code>}{<substitution>}.
  * Add French language variant "swiss".
  * Implement babelshorthands for Croatian.

Bug fixes:
  * Fix font family issue in headers (#355).
  * Fix whitespace issues in \text<lang> (#356).
  * Fix option-less \babelname in multi-variant languages (#357).
  * Fix some spacing inconsistencies with French, Latin, and Sanskrit (#358).
  * Fix issues with babelshorthands and graphics package (#368).
  * Fix some captions and improve numbering in Marathi (#370).
  * Fix Hungarian swapstrings feature (#373).
  * Fix lua punctuation code problem (#374).
  * Fix Bengali changecounternumbering option (#381).
  * Fix \text<lang> command with multiple paragraphs.
  * Actually implement documented german spelling variant '1996' (= 'new').
  * Fix Slovenian localalph option.
  * Fix Czech and Slovak splithyphens with typewriter fonts.
  * farsical.sty: fix spacing issue with some month names.
  * Fix directionalty of numbers in Hebrew with XeTeX.
  * Improve interoperatability with biblatex (some language variants did not work yet).

Interface and defaults changes:
  * Some boolean options had 'false' value by default, which meant if you passed
    them without value, the logic was reversed. This has been changed, leading to
    change of behavior should you have used one of these options without value (#363).
    Concerned are the following options:
    - babelshorthands in language belarusian, mongolian, ukrainian, and russian
      ('babelshorthands' now equals 'babelshorthand=true', no longer 'babelshorthands=false')
    - localalph in language slovenian ('localalph' now equals 'localalph=true')
    - latesthyphen in language german ('latesthyphen' now equals 'latesthyphen=true')
    - fullyear in package hebrewcal ('fullyear' now equals 'fullyear=true')
  * The command \setlanguagealias* (introduced in v1.46) does no longer define
    dedicated alias environments.
  * The babelnames for latin variants have been corrected to classiclatin, ecclesiasticlatin
    and medievallatin. This is how the hyphenation patterns and babel \extras are named, even
    though the variants can currently be selected in babel only via appended "dot modifier".
  * In accordance with the respective l3kernel change, \str_lower_case:n  has been renamed to
    \str_lowercase:n where used in polyglossia.sty. Thus polyglossia 1.47 requires l3kernel
    2020-01-12 at least.

Interface and defaults changes:
  * Per TeXLive request, the sub-package cyrillicnumbers.sty has been renamed to
    xpg-cyrillicnumbers.sty.
  * In Russian, all paragraphs are now indented by default, as common in Russian typography.
    The behavior can be opted out by indentfirst=false.
  * In Czech, splithyphens and lvna are enabled by default. Also, the option does now work
    as well with LuaTeX.
  * Changed option name "fraktur" to "blackletter" in German (the former is still available

    space now instead of a \thinspace (cf. #345).

    \makeatletter.  (Not necessary from a technical point of vue, because of one of the changes by Enrico reported below, but I like it better that way :-)

    From the git log:
    - Deleted setup for right-to-left writing direction, see http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2011-April/020319.html
    - Changed three appearances of \newcommand to \newrobustcmd, as the commands needs to be protected. Bug reported by "kamensky".
    - Corrected \datepolish as suggested by Piotr Kempa
    - Changed \lccode" into \lccode\string", because it might come into action at wrong times when " is active
    - Changed definition of key xpg@setup, as \@tmpfirst and \@tmpsecond were not expanded, causing dependence of \lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin to the last loaded language.  Raised by Vadim Rodionov on the XeTeX mailing list.
    - Deleted \bgroup and \egroup tokens from the definition of otherlanguage*; they serve no purpose (we are already inside an environment) and conflict with csquotes. Noticed by P. Lehman.
    - Changed the calls of \input to \xpg@input, which inputs the required file and resets the catcode of @ to the same value as it had before the input. Since each .ldf file starts with \makeatletter, the old behaviour would leave a category 11 @, which is wrong.
    - Added "\csuse{date#2}" to the definition of "otherlanguage*"

    signs ("Par exemple : les grands « espaces » du Canada ! ") are
    now replaced by the appropriate non-breaking spaces, as in Babel.

    (pending a complete re-implementation in v1.2):
    the font shape and series are no longer reset when switching language.
  * New macros for non-Western decimal digits
    (instead of fontmappings)
  * New gloss files for Asturian, Lithuanian and Urdu
  * hijrical.sty is now locale-aware: \hijritoday is
